* Functionalities
    * In-site search: based on user input, the website can fetch data from San Francisco Goverment using API;
    * Property information map: based on user input, the website can zoom into properties' locations and show the property information when user click on a property.
    * BART station location map: users can see BART station information when clicking on a station marker.
    * Comparison chart: On the collapsible sidebar, the website shows four comparison bar charts comparing property information between different TOD buffers.
