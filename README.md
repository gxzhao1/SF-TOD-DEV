    * Users could obtain the properties' details including built year, location, values, etc., 
    * Users could know about the impact of TOD on property values by different properties' usages, neighborhoods and years
* Functionalities
    * In-site search: the website can fetch the property data from San Francisco Goverment using API based on users' inputs
    * Location map: the website can zoom into the properties' locations that users are searching and show the details when users click the property.
    * Comparison chart: the website can show four comparison bar charts about built year, persona property value, land value and improvement value in the collapsed sidebar. With the charts and annotated texts, users could know about the impact of TOD easily.
