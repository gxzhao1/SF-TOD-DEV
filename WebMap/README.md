All experimental coding are conducted in main.html/css/js. The html with years are placeholders.

The project has realized most of the functions. Users could choose the neighborhood, property type, and year to look into the properties' details. Moreover, users could find property value comparison bar chart among three different TOD buffers in the sidebar with annotated texts.

However, users still need to use search button to search the properties instead of using "Enter" key in the keyboard.
